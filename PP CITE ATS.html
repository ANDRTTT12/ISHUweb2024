            The school is housed in a historic building located in the heart of
            the city on Bolshaya Morskaya Street. It specializes in the
            education of children in grades 1 to 5, in addition to offering
            preparatory groups for children aged 5 to 6, where, in an engaging
            manner, they are introduced to the fundamentals of school life.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Every effort is made to create optimal conditions for the full
            development of young students, fostering their creative potential
            and the unique abilities of each child. A wide range of fascinating
            subjects is offered to every pupil, including painting, sculpting,
            construction, design, choir, and dance. In collaboration with the
            Central City Children's Library named after Pushkin, the school runs
            a unique program, “Fundamentals of Information Culture,” which
            broadens the students' horizons and shapes their worldview.
